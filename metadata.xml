    <description>[h1] Time to fuel your gambling addiction with the Blackjack Dealer [/h1]

This mod adds a blackjack dealer beggar to the game.

The Dealer spawns by replacing an already existing slot machine or beggar.
By default, the spawn chance is 50% in arcade rooms and 0% in other rooms, however, that can be changed in the config.

To access the config, press [b]C[/b]. Note that you do [b]not[/b] need Mod Config Menu - everything is included!

You can play blackjack by walking up to the Dealer. There you will select your bet (1, 3, 5 or 10 coins). Each bet has a different reward pool - if you manage to [b]win[/b] the game, you will be granted a reward from the pool.
